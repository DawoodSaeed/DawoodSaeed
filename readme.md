# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **Dawood Saeed**, a passionate Full Stack JavaScript Developer on a mission to master JavaScript and beyond. With expertise in everything from higher-order functions and closures to promises and prototypes, I'm constantly honing my skills and tackling exciting challenges.

## 🚀 Currently Working On

I'm diving deep into a **news app** project at work—it's a multi-module system with intricate divisions. I've developed the web frontend using Angular, and it's live and loved by our clients. Now, I’m expanding our horizons with a Flutter mobile app version of the news app. Exciting times!

## 🌱 Learning & Exploring

Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by learning **Golang**. I'm delving into "For the Love of Go" and planning to tackle "Let's Go" next. If you have any tips, recommendations, or just want to chat about Go, feel free to reach out!
